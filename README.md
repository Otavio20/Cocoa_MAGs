Hi, here you can find the Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) we assembled from the publicly available cocoa metagenomes on NCBI database. Currently, our paper entitled "New insights on spontaneous cocoa fermentations from Metagenome-Assembled Genomes" is under review on Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology Journal.

Be free to use them in your research.
