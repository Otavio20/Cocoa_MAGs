Hi, here you can find the Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) we assembled from the publicly available cocoa metagenomes on NCBI database and MG-RAST repository. Currently, our paper entitled "Metagenome-assembled genomes aids in evidencing the dominant bacteria and fungi in cocoa fermentations" is under review.

Be free to use them in your research.
