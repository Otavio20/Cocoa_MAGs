Hi, here you can find the Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) we assembled from the publicly available cocoa metagenomes on NCBI database and MG-RAST repository presented in our paper entitled "Metagenome-assembled Genomes Contribute to Unravelling of the Microbiome of Cocoa Fermentation" published at Applied and Environmental Microbiology. Available in: https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00584-21.

Be free to use them in your research.
